Movie Recommender is a responsive web application that suggests movies to watch.

This is just a simple hobby project for me to get more familiar with different technologies, initially AngularJS and JavaScript.

Currently the Movue Recommender makes suggestions based on Genres with data from the themovie.org API.

Further development: Using to Node.js and Socket.io to make the application "social" and work on different devices connected to each other through the app. The goal is to suggest relevant movie based on several users opinons and inputs.
